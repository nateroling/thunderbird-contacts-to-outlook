Importing contacts from Thunderbird into Outlook is way harder than it
should be. This script will take a CSV file exported from Thunderbird
and massage it into one that will import cleanly into Outlook.

The following fields from Thunderbird will not be imported:
Display Name
Nickname
Screen Name
Web Page 2

Usage: python convert.py <input.csv> <output.csv>
